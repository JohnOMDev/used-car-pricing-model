# Used Car Pricing Model for Cars Cars Cars

Overview:

This repository contains code and resources for creating a pricing model for used cars, commissioned by the used car dealer “Cars Cars Cars.” The goal is to develop a regression model that accurately predicts the selling price of cars based on various features provided in the dataset.

Data:

	•	The dataset in the data folder called cars.csv contains information about car prices and several features that can be used to create the pricing model.
	•	The dependent variable is the “selling price” column in the file.
	•	The “present price” column describes the current price of the car if bought new, while other columns contain additional relevant features.

Objectives:

	•	Use regression and data preparation techniques to create the best pricing model for the client.
	•	Deliver a visually appealing notebook that explores all alternatives, describes relevant steps, and presents conclusions clearly.
	•	Provide context for the CTO of Cars Cars Cars, who has basic knowledge of regression techniques and a technical background but may need additional explanations.
	•	Present different model alternatives along with their performance metrics and describe the best-performing model.
